# 🕵️‍♂️ Fake vs Genuine Instagram Account Detection

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying **fake and genuine Instagram accounts** using **machine learning techniques** and **data visualization**.  
The goal is to analyze user-based metrics (followers, following, engagement rate, etc.) to determine whether an Instagram account is **real** or **fake/spam**.  

It involves **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building (Random Forest Classifier)**, and **dashboard visualization using Power BI**.

## 🚀 Objective

To develop a reliable model that can accurately classify Instagram accounts as **fake** or **genuine** using machine learning algorithms and visual analytics.

## 🧠 Key Steps & Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- The dataset was gathered from public Instagram data samples and Kaggle repositories.
- Contains account-level attributes such as username length, post count, followers, followings, engagement rates, etc.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates and missing values.
- Converted categorical columns into numerical values.
- Standardized numeric data for uniform scaling.
- Handled outliers and irrelevant columns.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored relationships between followers, following, likes, and comments.
- Identified patterns such as:
  - Fake accounts often have **high following and low followers**.
  - Genuine accounts show **balanced engagement**.
- Visualizations created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
